# IOReg: Individual Organism Registry

**IOReg** attempts to provide a mechanism to register arbitrary individual organisms of any given species, for the sake
of providing a universal, unique ID (in the form of a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)) to that
individual.
